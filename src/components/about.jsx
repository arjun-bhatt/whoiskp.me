        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>Kashmir Voices is a platform dedicated to sharing essays, stories, and creative
          content by Kashmiris worldwide. We celebrate the rich culture, history, and lived
          experiences of the Kashmiri people through authentic voices.    </p>
        <p>As a new platform, we are iterating quite quickly, and would love to hear from you regarding how this                platform might best be used. Current thoughts include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a platform to share funny anecdotes about Kashmiri idioms/aphorisms. E.g. in britain they say &quot;oh he
            wants his bread buttered on both sides&quot;, in hindi they might say &quot;दोनों हाथ लड्डू होना&quot; or [&quot;oh he
            wants&quot;] a laddoo in both hands. Might be fun / cute stories that are subtly telling regarding
            culture: in britain, they butter their bread, in india, they palm their laddoos</li>
          <li>a series of rants written by KPs who often feel tokenized/disenfranchised, constantly misquoted,
              with this being a publically facing place to get perspectives directly from the source</li>
          <li> your idea here</li>
              </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>  Whether you are a reader or a contributor, we welcome you to explore and share the
         diverse narratives that make Kashmir vibrant. And if you have ideas on what we are / what we should be,
          we would love to hear from you! Just reach out to arjun :)</p>
        <p><br />
