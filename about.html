            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                Kashmir Voices is a platform dedicated to sharing essays, stories, and creative
                content by Kashmiris worldwide. We celebrate the rich culture, history, and lived
                experiences of the Kashmiri people through authentic voices.

            <p>
                As a new platform, we are iterating quite quickly, and would love to hear from you regarding how this
                platform might best be used. Current thoughts include:
            <ul>
                <li>a platform to share funny anecdotes about Kashmiri idioms/aphorisms. E.g. in britain they say "oh he
                    wants his bread buttered on both sides", in hindi they might say "दोनों हाथ लड्डू होना" or "[oh he
                    wants] a laddoo in both hands". Might be fun / cute stories that are subtly telling regarding
                    culture: in britain, they butter their bread, in india, they palm their laddoos</li>
                <li>a series of rants written by KPs who often feel tokenized/disenfranchised, constantly misquoted,
                    with this being a publically facing place to get perspectives directly from the source</li>
                <li> your idea here</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether you are a reader or a contributor, we welcome you to explore and share the
                diverse narratives that make Kashmir vibrant. And if you have ideas on what we are / what we should be,
                we would love to hear from you! Just reach out to arjun :)
